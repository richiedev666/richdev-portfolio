              Hi, I'm Richie, talented full-stack web developer

            <p class="about-section__content__text">
              I don’t like to define myself by the work I’ve done. I define
              myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality
              is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging
              myself, and do interesting things
            </p>

            <p class="about-section__content__text">
              I try to write my codes as clean as possible, it is the most
              valuable skill of programmer.

            a natural ability to entertain and inspire. I’m never satisfied to
            just come up with ideas. Instead I have an almostimpulsive need to
            act on them

            My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests,
            hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors. I’m a fast learner,
            able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles
            with relative ease. I like to develop expertise in a number of areas
            over the course of my life and career.
